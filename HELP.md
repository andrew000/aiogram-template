    <summary>‚ùì Why PyCharm marks import with red color?</summary>

I use "unique" project structure, where app directory contains code, but root directory contains configuration files.

In PyCharm, right-click on the bot directory and select Mark Directory as -> Sources Root. Also, unmark project root
directory Unmark as Sources Root. This will fix the problem.
